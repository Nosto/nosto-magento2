## Installing

The preferred way of installing the extension is via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). If you don't have composer installed yet you can get it by following [these instructions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md). It's recommended to install composer globally. You will also need public key and private key from Magento Marketplace or Magento Connect in order to install packages to Magento 2 via Composer. Please follow these instructions to get public key and private key http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.1/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html. Once you have composer installed you can install Nosto extension (nosto/module-nostotagging).
